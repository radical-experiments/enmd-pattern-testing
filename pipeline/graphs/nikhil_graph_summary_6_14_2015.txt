The graphs called strong_scaling.png, weak_scaling.png, and step_scaling.png show the results of the experiments on the Pipeline Pattern. The measurement was the CU execution time in seconds, which was obtained through the performance profile:

	Strong Scaling: 
		- 3 steps, 128 instances
		- Core Count varied in the following sequence: 16, 32, 64, 128
		- Expectation: Execution time should decrease as core count increases

	Weak Scaling:
		- 3 steps
		- Cores/Instances varied from 16/16, 32/32, 64/64, 128/128
		- Expectation: Execution time would stay approximately the same as the cores/instances were increased

	Step Scaling:
		- 32 Cores, 64 instances
		- Steps varied from 1 to 9 by ones
		- Expectation: Execution time would increase as steps increased
